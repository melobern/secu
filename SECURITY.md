# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This script (C) is meant to be used in a terminal. You must have gcc installed, stdlib.h and unistd.h.
Normally, there are no vulnerability since the script only takes the numbers/letters you give to it and calculates with them.
This script doesn't need nor use access to any personal data. No open/read/write : only argc argv are used, with write, malloc, and free.
Memory is freed correctly, as checked with valgrind : no ram problem.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you ever see a vulnerability, you can send me a message.
